    Joint distribution given as nd array. X and Y assumed to take values from

    Parameters
    ----------
    X: array-like
        Sample observations of X. Must take values from [0,1,...,Nx-1],

        where Ny is the number of unique possible outcomes of Y.

    row_labels: bool, optional (default=False)
        Option to add an extra column, transpose([0,1,...,Nx-1]),
        to the left (i.e. column 0) of the distribution array. This extra
        column serves as labels for X; useful if permutations are performed

        Performs clustering on the master arrays of both past and future lightcones.

        Expects clustering algorithm to give integer cluster labels start at 0,
        with the "noise cluster" having label -1.

        Diagnostics of this clustering (what are the unique clusters and how many
        lightcones were assigned to each cluster) accessed through namedtuple
        Reconstructor.lc_cluster_diagnostic.

        sklearn objects for clustering -- but do save centroids***

        Parameters
        ----------
        past_params: dict,

            If past_cluster == 'kmeans':
                past_params must include values for 'nClusters' and 'maxIterations'
                and must set 'assignFlag' to True

        future_params: dict,
            Dictionary of keword arguments for future lightcone clustering algorithm.

            If future_cluster == 'kmeans':
                future_params must include values for 'nClusters' and 'maxIterations'
                and must set 'assignFlag' to True

        past_decay: int, optional (default=0)
            Exponential decay rate for lightcone distance used for past lightcone clustering.

        future_decay: int, optional (default=0)
            Exponential decay rate for lightcone distance used for future lightcone clustering.

        '''
        Hierarchical agglomerative clustering of lightcone morphs
        from a given joint distribution array (joint over lightcone clusters),
        where the first column is the labels for the plc clusters (pasts).
        This is needed because a random permutation should be done before
        clustering.

        Any noise clusters are ignored. If there is a noise cluster for pasts,
        it is assigned to the NAN state. If there is a noise cluster for futures,
        the counts of this cluster are removed from the morphs of each past.

        NOTE -- because I'm using dist metrics from scipy, I'm using p values to
        decide whether two distributions are identical, not strictly using a
        minimum distribution distance threshold (p value comparison is opposite
        of minimum distance comparison)

        Parameters
        ----------
        metric: function
            Python function that does a stastical comparison of two empirical distributions.
            In the current use, this function is expected to return a p value for this
            comparison.

        pval_threshold: float, optional (default=0.05)
            p value threshold for the distribution comparison. If the comparison p
            value is greater than pval_threshold, the two distributions are considered
            equivalent.
